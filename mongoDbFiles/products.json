  "description": "A mouse designed for gamers. Gaming mice have adjustable sensitivity, which is configurable as the number of dots per inch (DPI). The greater the DPI, the farther the cursor moves on screen with the same amount of mouse movement. In general, a higher DPI setting (1000 DPI and more) is used for gaming as well as for monitors with very high resolution. However, in a video game, the higher DPI may help or hinder depending on the zoom level of the scene. Higher DPI lets the gamer make quick movements, while lower DPI allows for smaller, precise movements. See DPI, gaming PC and gaming keyboard.",

Although there are several controllers with dials and levers for games, the W, A, S and D letter keys on the standard QWERTY keyboard are also widely used. On gaming keyboards, which are mostly mechanical, the key switches require less depression and result in faster action for games. There may also be extra keys that are user configurable for macros (commonly used key sequences). See video game controller, gaming mouse, gaming PC, mechanical keyboard, WASD keys and macro.",

  "description": "A device that converts sound waves into analogous electrical waves. Commonly called a \"mic\" (pronounced \"mike\"), it contains a flexible diaphragm composed of film or foil that vibrates as it makes contact with the sound. The diaphragm movement modulates an electrical current by various methods. In a carbon mic, used in telephones for more than a hundred years, the diaphragm alters the pressure in carbon grains, changing its resistance.",
